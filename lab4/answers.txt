Your Task {#task}
Your task is to create both a LinkedList class that utilizes a Node class that stores integers, and performs the following tasks:

push_front
Adds an integer to the front of the list
push_back
Adds an integer to the end of the list
insert
Adds an integer to the list at a specific index
delete
Searches for & removes a specific element in the list
contains
Returns true if the given value exists in the list. False otherwise.
size
Returns the # of elements in the list
to_string
Returns all elements in the list concatenated into a single string. The list 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 would return "5 3 4 2"
You're welcome to either make a Node class (in which case, the friend keyword might come in handy) or make your Node a struct.

Requirements {#reqs}
Implement to_string, push_front, and push_back
Implement contains and size
Implement insert and delete
